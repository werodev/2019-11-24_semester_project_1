Interactive, informative and appealing Community Science Museum website. Target audience - primary and middle school children and their families. Design cannot be childish, target audience is inquisitive and inteligent. Website should be responsive and be easy to use on different types of devices.

## Description

This project shows what I've learned in 1st semester(January 2019). Things it should reflect include design priciples, project management, communication technology, developing with HTML and CSS.

Tasks/Goals:
- detailed work schedule with milestones for design, coding, testing and report
- carefully considered target audience with appropriate design (typography, color scheme, compositional principles)
- 4-6 pages
- semantic and neatly indented HTML
- external CSS sheets (keep in mind DRY principle)
- images should not be over 200kb to prevent slow load time
- fallow WCAG principles 
- responsive/atractive/easy to use on different devices
- content strategy and SEO (meta tags and alt text)

## Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3

## I'm proud of

Things we struggle the most with, are the ones we cherish, in this case it was positioning H1 on top of an image. I also really like the logo idea.
